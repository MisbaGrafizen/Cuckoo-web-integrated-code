                        If your passport has expired, lost or or the pages have been exhausted, its time to renew your passport. For passport renewal process in India, you must submit your old passport along with the supporting documents. The old passport is then returned with a hole punched in the cover and a canceled stamp, which invalidates it (in case of reissue of passport). Once you’ve submitted your application for renewal of passport, it generally takes lesser amount of time than a first-time fresh passport application — four to six weeks. With reference to passport renewal process in India, police verification is not required or only post police verification may be required. There can be exceptions for reissue in lieu of complete change of name / lost passport / change in the particulars on the first or last cover page of the passport, depending on records available in the Passport Office System. It is very important to renew the passport before it expires for a hassle-free international travel.

                        Always cross-check your passport application before submitting because even a small mistake of forgetting to to complete one section of the form or missing signature can derail the application process or even result into rejection. Moreover, the passport fees are not returned if the application is rejected. The final decision to issue the passport is at the discretion of the Passport officer.
